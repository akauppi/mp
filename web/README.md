- `npm`

## Opening

Running a server within the VM (whose IP you know from `multipass info web`), you can simply launch a browser on the host.

e.g. 

```
$ open http://192.168.64.85:5173/
```

## Maintenance 

**Updating (within the sandbox)**

$ sudo npm install -g npm

`npm` will remind you of that, no doubt
