#
# Note: This is ONLY A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE. You can always point the browser to the full '{ip}:{port}' URL.
#     Also, if the assumptions done in this script are not to your liking, you can easily pick the commands and
#     perform similar actions manually - the way You like! :)

# Usage:
#   $ PORT=x[,y] [MP_NAME=...] [MSG="...\n..."] {path-to}/port-fwd.sh [-d]
#
# Notes:
#   After updates of Multipass, the key may have changed. Just remove the `~/.mp.key` and recreate it (as the script
#   instructs).   // tbd. detect the situation when the key is wrong???

  To use this script, you need to provide a _user_space_ copy of the key Multipass uses between the host and VM's
  at $_LOCAL_KEY. It's currently not there.

  Execute the command below. Leaving the otherwise hidden (needing sudo) key there should be fine; it cannot be reached
  by outside parties, anyways. And you can remove the copy after port forwarding is no longer necessary.

  If you dislike the idea altogether, you can still make some other workflow alongside this template.

  ${bold}sudo cp $(printf %q "$_KEY") $_LOCAL_KEY${unbold}
  ${bold}sudo chown $USER $_LOCAL_KEY${unbold}
  ${bold}chmod 600 $_LOCAL_KEY${unbold}
